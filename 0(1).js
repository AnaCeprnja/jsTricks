//O(1) --> Constant time --> no matter how many times we use something or how big the array we are always grabbing items in array in the same amount of time
//this is excellent in the complexity chart <-- we love 0(1) because it is great in terms of scalability
//siimply always commes down to 0(1) because even if we are grabbing 100 items it is the same amount of time

//graph would look like this just straight
